    <p>This paper contains a very detailed assessment of the energy consumed by Google's data centres in the US, EU, Singapore, Chile, and Taiwan. </p>
    <p>I'm unsure how Australia fits in to Google's data centre stable. They definitely offer more regions in Google Cloud Platform (including Australia) than they mention in this report - or any of their other similar reports about their data centre efficiency. Possibly those extra regions are all co-located?</p>
    <p>However this is a very thorough approach to analysing and assessing energy mix in the data centres they do include.</p>
    <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/Google_2018-Environmental-Report.pdf">Environmental Report - Google, 2018</a>
    <p>Generally this is a good report on a number of fronts that makes a genuine commitment to the environment clear.</p>
    <p>That said, the only mention of Australia in this report is a satellite image of New Caledonia (???).</p>
    <p>The way that Google phrases their "100% renewable energy" statement is pretty disingenuous in places - you could mistake it for a statement that they only use renewable energy. They used about 8TWh of electricity and made agreements to purchase about 8TWh of renewable energy (including the relevant certificates); they aren't always in the same continent, as is made clear by the map that skips out Australia and most of Asia. They then appear to retire the Renewable Energy Certificates or Guarantees of Origin certificates and sell the excess back onto the grid. </p>
